# geo-extension-to-schemaorg
In this repository we collect requirements for a proposed extension to schema.org to facilitate the discovery of geospatial data.

*Background*

The testbed Spatial Data on the web aims to develop methods and tooling to integrate spatial data into the web of documents. In order to achieve this spatial data is annotated with the schema.org vocabulary. While working with schema.org we noticed that most of the Things that are described with schema.org are modeled without a spatial focus in mind. For example the properties that describe "location" are spread over the schema, and the Things that can actually have a location are limited.
