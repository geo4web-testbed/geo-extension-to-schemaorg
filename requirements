This is a placeholder for requirements for the spatial extension.

In principle, every schema:Thing is capable of having a hasLocation property. For some classes this might be illogical, but we leave it up to the modeller to decide (AAA principle).
A location has attributes, such as a shape, a coordinate reference system and coordinates.
The shape of a location can be point, line or polygon (maybe in the future, if necessary, derivatives thereof)

There are additional properties that contain the topology of a location. This topoElogy is annotated, not calculated in the data. Examples: nextTo, above, 

More specific types of a location property, such as jobLocation, will be superseded by hasLocation.
It is not necessary to say (as it is now):
JobPosting jobLocation Place
One could just as much say:
JobPosting hasLocation Place

The hasLocation property has an inverse property (isLocationOf)
